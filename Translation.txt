# Course: Google Cloud Platform Fundamentals - Core Infrastructure
# LAB : GCP Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine
## objectives:

   - Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

   - Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

   - Connect between the two instances.

 # steps:

 1- Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console :
    
     gcloud Compute instances Create my-vm-1 --machine-type "n1-standar-1" --image-project 
     "double-Cloud " --image "debian-9-stretchv20190213" --subnet "default" --tags http

    gcloud Compute firewell-rules Create allow-http --action=allow --destination-INGRESS 
    --rules=http:00 --target-tags=http

 2- Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface  :
  
     gcloud config set Compute/zones us-central1-b
     gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" \
    --machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
    --image-project "debian-cloud" \
    --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" \
    --subnet "default"

3- Connect between the two instances :
     
     3-1 use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 ever the network:
       
       *Connect to my-vm-2: gcloud ssh ssh my-vm-2
       *ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2: ping -c 4 my-vm-1
       *use ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1 from my-vm-2: ssh my-vm-1
       *At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:
               sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y 
       *Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:
               sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
       *Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:
               Hi from ACHOUAK 
       *exit the editor and confirm that the web server is serviring the new page :
                curl http://localhost/
                and the result is :
         "  The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text. "
        *exit the command on my-vm-2 :
                 exit 
        *To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:
                curl http://my-vm-1/
               and the result is :
         "  The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text. "
     3-2 get externel IP of my-vm-1 : 
               gcloud compute instances list

     3-3 past coppied IP address of my-vm-1 into a new browser : 
                result:
                "You will see your web server's home page, including your custom text".
