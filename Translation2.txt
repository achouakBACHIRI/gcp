# Course: Google Cloud Platform Fundamentals - Core Infrastructure
#LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with BigQuery
## objectives:

   - Load data from Cloud Storage into BigQuery.

   - Perform a query on the data in BigQuery.

#steps:

1-Load data from Cloud Storage into BigQuery:
  
   gcloud Compute dataset create "your-project" --Dataset-ID "logdata" 
   --Data-location --logdata "CSV file"
   gcloud Compute table create --Create-table-from "Google Cloud Storage" --type "gs://cloud-training/gcpfci/access_log.csv"
   --destination-name " logdata" --Table-name "accesslog" --Table-type "Native table"
   --schema --Auto detect "Schema and input Parameters" 
   gcloud Compute --logdata "accesslog"

2-Perform a query on the data in BigQuery :

    2-1 n the Query editor window, type query
    2-2 Because you told BigQuery to automatically discover the schema when you load the data,
       the hour of the day during which each web hit arrived is in a field called int_field_6:
       "select int64_field_6 as hour, count(*) as hitcount from logdata.accesslog
            group by hour order by hour"
    2-3 Click Run and examine the results.
